# Bech32 C#

Implement Bech32 with error detection in C#.
Build the code using dotnet core:
```
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet build
```

Run the tests using:
```
$ dotnet run
```

This is a reference implementation not meant to be used as library.
Bech32 is implemented as a part of [NBitcoin library](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin).
